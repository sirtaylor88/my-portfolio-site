      <h5>Abstract</h5>
      <p class="text-justify">In this thesis, bimetallic Au-Pd nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized and their structure at the atomic scale studied by aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy to determine its influence of the structure on the catalytic and thermodynamic properties of the NPs. Au-Pd NPs with controlled size and composition were deposited on both crystalline surfaces (NaCI, MgO, Ti0<sub>2</sub>, Zr0<sub>2</sub>) and amorphous carbon by pulsed laser deposition. High-resolution TEM imaging of the NPs shows that their equilibrium shape is of truncated octahedral type. On oxide supports, various epitaxial relationships of Au-Pd NPs with the supports were established. Knowing the exact shape of the NPs, we have determined the interface and triple-line energies in these particle-oxide support systems by using a generalized Wulff-Kaishew model combined with distance measurements in TEM images of projection taken parallel to the metal-substrate interface. Moreover, the catalytic performances of Au-Pd nanoparticles deposited on oxide substrates were tested in two reactions: hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene and oxidation of carbon monoxide. Furthermore, by subjecting these Au-Pd nanoparticles at high temperature annealing treatments in vacuum, we have provided the first experimental evidence of the existence of chemically ordered phases L<sub>10</sub> and L<sub>12</sub> in Au-Pd nanoalloy at high temperature (500-600°C). The chemical ordering is shown to proceed in parallel with a thermally-activated two-tier Ostwald ripening process.</p>

        <em>Figure 2</em>: (a) Low-magnification TEM images and the corresponding SAED patterns of two annealed specimens (samples A and B). Sample A consists of initially disordered fcc NPs, similar to those in Fig. 1, annealed at 600 C for 10 hours. Sample B consists of NPs with a composition comparable to those in Fig. 1 annealed at 500 C for 8 hours. The size distribution of the two annealed samples are given in the insets of (a) and (b). The size distribution in (a) is constructed by analyzing the size of 240 NPs in sample A. The one shown in (b) is built from the size distribution of 237 NPs from three different TEM images of sample B. (c) and (d) show SAED patterns obtained on samples A and B, respectively. In (c), 001 and 110 superlattice reflections and a splitting of the 002 diffraction rings are visible.

        <em>Figure 3</em>: UHRTEM images of L<sub>10</sub>(a – c) and L<sub>12</sub>(d – f) Au–Pd nanoparticles from samples A and B. The corresponding Fourier Transform patterns are shown below each image. (a – c) L<sub>10</sub>-ordered NPs imaged close to the [100] (a) and [001] (b and c) directions. In those directions, the chemical order is evidenced through the appearance of 001 and 110 superlattice reflections in the Fourier Transform patterns. The L <sub>12</sub> structures in (d – f) are in close [001], [101] and [112] orientations, respectively. Again, strong superlattice reflections appear on the Fourier Transform patterns.
